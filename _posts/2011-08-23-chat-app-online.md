I previously bloged about my [NodeChat app](http://rogchap.com/2011/08/10/my-nodejs-chat-app/) that I created, with the code up on [GitHub](https://github.com/rogchap/SampleProjects/tree/master/NodeChat).

I decided to publish the app so that you lovely people could have a play with it without having to download the source and run it locally. It also served as a good walktrough in putting together a nodejs production server. I'll write up a seperate post on this.
