title: The Start of yet Another Blog
---

Over the course of my career I've had quite a few blogs, however I have struggled to maintain writing content for each one. I still write blog posts for [-Storm ID-](http://blog.stormid.com) (I've left Storm ID. and now work for M&C Saatchi in Australia) but any personal blogs have now all disappeared from various hosting platforms.

The setup
---------
This blog is hosted on [GitHub pages](http://pages.github.com). GitHub pages allows me to be in control of my blog and makes it super simple to publish a new blog post; it's as simple as:
	$ git push
Also, by hosting my blog posts on GitHub (should) mean that I won't loose any of my posts and they will be all version controlled via my git repository.

[Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/) is also at the heart of this blog. This is mainly because GitHub pages support it (it was written by one of the co-founders of GitHub after all) and it is a really lightweight way to publish HTML content. Jekyll's power comes in the form of layouts, templates and plugins. I'm currently using [Daring Fireball's Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) as my template engine for my blog post, but the great thing about Jekyll is that I can change to [textile](http://textile.thresholdstate.com/) (for example) for any one post and Jekyll will deal with the rest i.e. I can mix 'n' match.

About Me
--------
I'm an Application Developer living in Sydney, Australia. I've been in the development world commercially for 10 years now, but have been an indie developer for much longer.

My core programming language has been C# and the .NET framework, however, the last two years has seen me develop my skills in Objective-C (iOS development), Java (Android development) and even PHP; my current development enviroment of choice is Node.js.  

I love building *new things* and I'm always on the lookout for the next big thing in technology; software or hardware.

The Beginning
-------------
I'll be writing about anything I think would be useful and will be sharing more about my development *stuff* as time goes on. Until then, thanks for stopping by.
