title: Twibbon on your iPhone
---

[Twibbon](http://twibbon.com) is a Twitter and Facebook application that allows you to create and select a campaign and display a *twibbon* on your avatar.

Twibbon was created by our ideas arm of the company: Storm Ideas. I had the privilege of building the iPhone version.

Twibbon was a fun app to build and includes some cool image manipulation and getting to grips with UIGestures. In a future post I will share some of the image code, but for now go download the new Twibbon app now available on the App Store:
