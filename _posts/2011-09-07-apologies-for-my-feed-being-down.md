title: Apologies for my feed being down
---

Recently I made a post with an "&" symbol in the post's title. The title did not get properly encoded and caused the xml atom feed to fail. 

Apologies to all my subscribers, and I hope you can catch up on older posts (some cool Node stuff!). 

Feed is now up and running again!
